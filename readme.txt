WeChat Pay payment gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Woo WeChatPay is a companion plugin for WP Weixin that adds a WeChat Pay payment gateway to WooCommerce-powered websites.
Customers can pay both in the WeChat browser (JSAPI), mobile browsers (H5), or from their computer via a QR code.
Upon purchase and if activated in settings, customers may receive a notification in the WeChat Official Account with a templated message if they are a follower.

### Requirements

* A [China Mainland WeChat Official Account](https://mp.weixin.qq.com) - **Service account**.
* A [China Mainland WeChat Pay account](https://pay.weixin.qq.com).
* **[WP Weixin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-weixin)** installed, activated, enabled and properly configured.

### Important Notes

* Does NOT support [cross-border payments](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wechatpay_guide/intro_settle.shtml) (possibly planned for v1.4).
* Make sure to read the "TROUBLESHOOT, FEATURE REQUESTS AND 3RD PARTY INTEGRATION" section below and [the full documentation](https://github.com/froger-me/woo-wechatpay/blob/master/README.md) before contacting the author.

### Overview

This plugin adds the following major features to WooCommerce and WP Weixin:

* **Payment of WooCommerce orders in WeChat mobile app:** uses the WeChat JSAPI for a seamless experience.
* **Payment of WooCommerce orders in mobile web browser app:** calls the WeChat H5 API for a seamless experience.
* **Payment of WooCommerce orders with WeChat via QR Code:** for customers using WeChat Pay in classic browsers.
* **Support for "pay again":** allows customers to continue the payment process of Pending orders.
* **Refund of WooCommerce orders:** possibility to refund orders manually in a few clicks, and support for automatic refund in case the transaction failed.
* **Templated message notification in WeChat:** send a WeChat templated message to the customer upon purchase (if following the Official Account - completely customisable via [filters](https://github.com/froger-me/woo-wechatpay/blob/master/README.md#user-content-filters)).
* **Multi-currency support:** using an exchange rate against Chinese Yuan configured in the settings.

Compatible with [WooCommerce Multilingual](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-multilingual/), [WPML](http://wpml.org/), [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/), [WordPress Multisite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network), and [many caching plugins](https://github.com/froger-me/wp-weixin/blob/master/README.md#user-content-object-cache-considerations).

### Troubleshoot, feature requests and 3rd party integration

Unlike most WeChat integration plugins, Woo WeChatPay is provided for free.  

Woo WeChatPay is regularly updated, and bug reports are welcome, preferably on [Github](https://github.com/froger-me/woo-wechatpay/issues). Each bug report will be addressed in a timely manner, but issues reported on WordPress may take significantly longer to receive a response.  

Woo WeChatPay has been tested with the latest version of WordPress and WooCommerce - in case of issue, please ensure you are able to reproduce it with a default installation of WordPress, WooCommerce plugin, and Storefront theme and any of the aforementioned supported plugins if used before reporting a bug.  

Feature requests (such as "it would be nice to have XYZ") or 3rd party integration requests (such as "it is not working with XYZ plugin" or "it is not working with my theme") will be considered only after receiving a red envelope (红包) of a minimum RMB 500 on WeChat (guarantee of best effort, no guarantee of result). 

To add the author on WeChat, click [here](https://froger.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wechat-qr.png), scan the WeChat QR code, and add "Woo WeChatPay" as a comment in your contact request.
